# 👩🏾‍⚕️ Sabine | Doctor, Builder, Advocate

Hi! I'm Sabine, a general practitioner (GP) passionate about solving real healthcare problems with smart, ethical, and beautiful tech.

## 🧠 Who I Am
I’m a general practitioner, researcher, and healthcare innovator building tools to:
- Prevent medical-legal conflict (`Doctors in Court`)
- Streamline care with AI and automation (`CareForAI`)
- Empower international doctors & students with training platforms
- Bridge tech and medicine with open-source projects

I focus especially on immigrant doctors, women in medicine, and mental health in clinical practice.

### 🚀 Why It Matters
Each tool is built with one goal in mind: **to protect doctors and improve patient care.**  

I’m on a mission to:

* Make healthcare **safer** by making legal knowledge **accessible**
* Help patients **understand** more, with less confusion
* Save doctors **time**, **money**, and **mental energy** with tools they actually love

### 🔧 Tech I Use

* `Python`, `Jupyter`, `Make.com`, `Notion`, `Chrome Extensions`
* `GPT-4`, `ElevenLabs`, `Midjourney`
* Bonus: I code everything as a doctor with no full-time tech team.

### 🌍 Currently Building

* A fully automated video pipeline for **Doctors in Court** (scrape > summarize > voiceover > video > post)
* A GitHub portfolio to inspire and empower other healthcare professionals
