### 🚀 Why It Matters

I’m on a mission to:

* Make healthcare **safer** by making legal knowledge **accessible**
* Help patients **understand** more, with less confusion
* Save doctors **time**, **money**, and **mental energy** with tools they actually love

### 🔧 Tech I Use

* `Python`, `Jupyter`, `Make.com`, `Notion`, `Chrome Extensions`
* `GPT-4`, `ElevenLabs`, `Midjourney`
* Bonus: I code everything as a doctor with no full-time tech team.

### 🌍 Currently Building

* A fully automated video pipeline for **Doctors in Court** (scrape > summarize > voiceover > video > post)
* A GitHub portfolio to inspire and empower other healthcare professionals
